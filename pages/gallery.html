          The Moniyan Empire of the Land of Dawn once enjoyed the blessings of angels. The Angel of Light, Rafaela,
          shone down on
          the people and healed all of their illnesses; the Angel of Dark, Argus, became the punisher of crime. Together
          they
          maintained peace and balance throughout the land.

          Alucard was born in the capital of the empire. His parents were once mentors to Tigreal\'s Order of Knights.
          In one of
          his trials, Tigreal\'s overconfidence led to Alucard\'s parents sacrificing their lives in order to save him
          from
          demons. Unable to accept this harsh reality, Alucard went into the territory of the demons in order to search
          for his
          parents. All he found on the battlefield, however, was the family crest worn on his parents\' chest. He was
          then
          suddenly ambushed by the demons, who captured and tortured him for months. He was eventually freed by a demon
          hunter,
          after which he took up refuge as a resident of the Temple of Light.

          Pada zaman prasejarah, seekor naga hitam muncul dari reruntuhan meteor yang jatuh di tanah Cadia Riverland.
          Dunia
          Oriental yang pada saat itu dikuasai oleh Great Dragon pun akhirnya berhasil diporak-poranda oleh sang naga
          hitam dan
          membawa kehancuran besar bagi tanah Cadia Riverland.

          Johnson, with a hardy constitution as solid as a rock, ran through the dome stadium like a heavy truck, the
          cheers of
          girls bursting from everywhere. He led his team to lift the champion\'s trophy and achieved the highpoint of
          his life as
          a superstar quarterback with millions of fans. However, fortune is always fickle. A little girl suddenly
          rushed into the
          road while Johnson was driving his sports car. To avoid hitting the little girl he swerved and severely
          crashed his car.
          A massive hemorrhage was going to take his life quickly.

          The birth of Saber traces back to the early years of Laboratory 1718. In the beginning, he was a scholar in
          one of the
          most famous invention teams in Scholar City. Dr. Rooney hoped that this team would be able to unlock the
          ultimate
          potential of mechanical invention and lead the world into a glorious age of technology. But the radically
          intellectual
          scientists became more and more obsessed with modifications to the human body. They engaged in insane
          experiments that
          ignored the limits of the human body. They were willing to try anything, use any combination of technology and
          power, so
          long as it enhanced human abilities that had not yet been unlocked by nature. Because of this, Dr. Rooney was
          forced to
          disband this team and banished the scientists.

          There was a tale of a Great Dragon that had nine sons. They were unique to each other and responsible for
          their own
          duties. Seldom did the Great Dragon gather with his sons, however, as the adopted son, Zilong assisted the
          Great Dragon
          instead of the royal sons. In the eyes of the Great Dragon, Zilong was way better in his personalities and
          abilities,
          which made Zilong deeply trusted by him. Long ago, Zilong swore an oath to roam from world to world, assisting
          wise
          rulers by the Great Dragon\'s decree. Whenever a new king was in need of his strength, Zilong traverses space
          and time
          to remove all obstacles and enemies before the king, using spear fighting techniques endowed upon him by the
          Great
          Dragon. Now the Land of Dawn is in great danger and Zilong has come to its aid. With his sense of justice and
          bravery,
          Zilong defeated many enemies and his name spread among the land. Regardless of how strong the enemy was,
          Zilong\'s spear
          would not forgive any evil who tried to destroy this continent.

          Long ago, the members of the House of Akakage were hailed as \"the Gods of Ninja Arts\". For generations, the
          Akakages
          researched and taught advanced ninjutsu. In order to reach the pinnacle of ninja arts, the Akakages used a
          forbidden
          ninjutsu to rid their hearts of evil, anger, and greed by condensing them into a demon called, Hanekage. No
          one expected
          that Hanekage would have consciousness, despite lurking within their bodies.

          The Shura clan have thrived in isolation for countless generations, their men renowned for being the world\'s
          bravest
          fighters, and their women famed for being the world\'s greatest beauties. At the heart of the Shura clan\'s
          beliefs lies
          the legend of the Three Thousand Worlds. The legend speaks of three thousand secret worlds, which upon
          entering, one
          must face various levels of psychic trials and advance to world after world upon victory. The people of the
          Shura clan
          have discovered a way to enter these worlds, and only those who have conquered over three hundred worlds are
          granted the
          title of \"Ashura\", raising them to the level of a demigod in the eyes of their people. However, in the
          innumerable
          eons of Shura history, none managed to conquer the fabled three thousand worlds, until Martis appeared.

          Franco\'s home is in the eternally frozen seas beyond the land of Northern Vale. This continent of ice and
          snow is where
          the sea people have made a life for themselves, but the resurrection of Captain Bane has destroyed their
          formerly
          peaceful lives. Franco and his comrades have banded together to oppose Bane\'s rule and bring peace back to
          the seas.
